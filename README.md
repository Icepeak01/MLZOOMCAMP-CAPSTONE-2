## Project Overview

This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict loan repayment status based on various applicant features. Leveraging multiple classification algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Neural Networks, the model provides accurate predictions to assist financial institutions in making informed lending decisions. The application is deployed using Flask and Docker, making it accessible via a web interface for real-time predictions.

## Problem Description

Loan default is a critical issue for financial institutions, leading to significant financial losses and impacting credit availability. Accurately predicting whether an applicant will repay a loan enables lenders to mitigate risks, tailor loan offerings, and ensure financial stability. This project leverages data science techniques to build a predictive model that assesses the likelihood of loan repayment based on applicant demographics, financial history, and other relevant features.

### How the Model Helps:

- Risk Mitigation: Identifies high-risk applicants, reducing potential defaults.
- Operational Efficiency: Streamlines the loan approval process by automating risk assessment.
- Personalized Offerings: Enables lenders to customize loan terms based on applicant profiles.
- Financial Stability: Enhances the overall financial health of lending institutions by minimizing losses.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **Docker:** Ensure Docker is installed on your machine. [Installation Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- **Python 3.9:** Required for running training and prediction scripts.

### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/loan-prediction.git
cd loan-prediction
```

### Setup Python Environment
It's recommended to use a virtual environment
```bash
# Using virtualenv
python3.9 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

# Upgrade pip
pip install --upgrade pip

# Install dependencies
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```



### Usage
Running the Flask Application Locally
```bash
# Activate Virtual Environment
source venv/bin/activate

# Navigate to the app Directory
cd app

# Run the Application
python flaskapp.py
```

### Docker Deployment
```bash
# Build the Docker Image:
docker build -t loan-prediction-app .

# Run the Docker Container:
docker run -d -p 5000:5000 loan-prediction-app

```
Access the App:

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080.

### Accessing the Deployed Application
The application is deployed on Render and can be accessed via the following link:

ðŸ‘‰ [Loan prediction App](https://ml-zoocamp-project-1.onrender.com/)

## Training the Model
The training process involves data preparation, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training with multiple classifiers, and evaluation. The final model is saved for deployment.

Running the Training Script
Ensure Dependencies are Installed:
``` bash
pip install -r app/requirements.txt
```
Run the Training Script:
``` bash
python scripts/train.py
```

Model Saving:

The trained model, scaler, and column names are saved in the app/ directory as:
  - ldsqr_lr_model.pkl
  - ldsqr_scaler.pkl
  - col_name.pkl

## Model Evaluation
After training, the model was evaluated on the test dataset with the following results:
